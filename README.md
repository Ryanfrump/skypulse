Iam building a basic weather application that uses the weather.gov API, found here: [https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-apiLinks to an external site.](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). It will have these pages and sections:

- Home
  - Modal with a form to sign in (doesn't do anything yet)
    - Username
    - Password
    - Forgot username or password
  - Navbar:
    - Links to the "About", "FAQ", and "Contact" pages
  - Sidebar from bootstrap (you'll find it under the "Navbar" components), find one that lets you expand/collapse like a drawer
    - You are welcome to use something other than bootstrap
  - Cards:
    - Current weather conditions
    - Current weather alerts (e.g. Excessive Heat Warning)
    - Have a card that displays the weather over the next 24 hours
      - Use a line chart from Chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/line/line.html
- About
  - Have a simple description of who you are and why you made this site. Remember that this is likely going to be on your portfolio, so I would advise not saying something like "I'm making this site because my teacher is a cruel taskmaster who is mercilessy making me build this in order to pass the class. He laughs even now as my tears stain the keys of my laptop."
- FAQ
  - Add a couple sample entries

    - Name
    - Email
    - Category

      - Report
